RTJ (Ring Type Joint) gaskets are metallic sealing rings used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications, primarily in oil and gas, petrochemical, and power industries.
RTJ gaskets are designed to withstand extreme conditions where conventional gaskets might fail, making them ideal for pipelines, pressure vessels, and other critical components. 
They are designed to be durable and resilient, capable of withstanding repeated pressure and temperature changes.
