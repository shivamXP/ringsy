Grafoil is a flexible graphite sheet material, derived from pure, natural graphite flakes.
Its high purity and low sulfur content contribute to its exceptional sealability and high-temperature capabilities. 
Grafoil gaskets are ideal for sealing difficult high-temperature applications, chemical environments, and low bolt load situations. 
They are commonly used in oil and gas, chemical plants, refining, automotive, nuclear, and industrial sectors, according to Sealing Device
