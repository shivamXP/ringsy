The spiral wound gasket is semi-metallic, comprising of a spirally wound v shaped stainless steel strip and a non-metallic filler material, such as graphite or PTFE.

Gaskets used in the oil, gas and petrochemical industries need to be engineered to cope with high pressures, extreme temperatures and chemical attack.
