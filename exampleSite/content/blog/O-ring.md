O-rings are typically made from elastomers like rubber, but can also be made from plastics or metals depending on the application's specific needs. 
O-rings can be used in static applications (where the seal is not subject to movement) or dynamic applications (where there is relative motion between the parts). 
O-rings are cost-effective, easy to install, and can be used in a wide range of applications.
