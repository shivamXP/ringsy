An envelope gasket is a type of gasket where a core material (like rubber or metal) is encased in a PTFE envelope. 
This design provides the benefits of the core material's strength and resilience, combined with PTFE's excellent chemical resistance, 
temperature resistance, and non-stick.The core material (e.g., rubber, metal, or fiber) can be chosen to provide the necessary mechanical strength and flexibility for the specific application.
