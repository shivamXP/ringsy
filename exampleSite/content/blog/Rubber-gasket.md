A rubber gasket which is an elastic component is both simple and effective. They are used to fill the space between two mating surfaces, creating a barrier that prevents fluids, gases, or contaminants from leaking when compression is applied. Basically, elastomeric materials like natural rubber, silicone, neoprene, or ethylene propylene diene monomer are used to create these seals. Their many advantages including flexibility, resilience, and sealing properties, make them invaluable in numerous applications.
