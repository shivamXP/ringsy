Gland packings are a type of seal used to prevent fluid leakage in rotating or reciprocating equipment like pumps and valves.
Traditional gland packings are made of braided or twisted fiber, while modern materials include PTFE, graphite, and other synthetic materials. 
Gland packings can be categorized into soft packings (yarn, vegetable, or synthetic fibers) and metallic packings (reinforced with wire for high temperatures and pressures).
